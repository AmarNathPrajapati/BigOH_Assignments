bhai, problem ko samajh

pahale 5/3/25 ko maine ke 12/3/25 ke liye leave apply kiya tha jo approve ho gaya
but date 6/3/25 se meri tabiya me sudhar nahi hua.... toh mujhe 10/3/25-11/3/25 ka bhi holiday chahiye

Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I had previously applied for leave on 12th March on 4th March, which was approved. However, I have been experiencing health issues since yesterday, including mouth ulcers, stomach pain, and headaches, which are affecting my ability to work and focus.

Considering my condition, I kindly request additional leave for 10th and 11th March for proper rest and treatment. I will resume work after Holi in a better state.

I appreciate your understanding and approval.
